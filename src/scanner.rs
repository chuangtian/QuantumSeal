//! Recursive file inventory and indicator matching.
//!
//! The scanner walks a directory tree (standard library only), reads text-like
//! files, lowercases each line once, and tests every rule's needles against it.
//! Matches are grouped into [`Finding`]s that are later assembled into the
//! CryptoBOM.
